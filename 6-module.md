### @module

```typescript
import state from './state';
import getters from './getters';
import mutations from './mutations';
import actions from './actions'

/**
 * @module auth
 *
 * Vuex module for managing state, getters, mutations, and actions related to the "auth" feature.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This module handles the logic and data management specific to the "auth" feature of your application.
 * It includes the state, getters, mutations, and actions required for this feature.
 * Use the `@module` tag to declare a JavaScript module and specify its name. In this case,
 * the module is named 'auth' and it exports an object with a VueX store module. The `namespaced: true`
 * property ensures that all the getters, actions, and mutations within the module are namespaced
 * under 'auth', which helps prevent naming collisions with other modules in your store.

export default {
    namespaced: true,
    state,
    getters,
    mutations,
    actions,
};
