### @global

@global is used to indicate that a symbol is global and can be accessed from any part of the code. It's often used for objects or values that are added to the global scope, like window objects in web development.


```typescript
/**
 * @global
 * Description of the global symbol.
 * 
 *  @remarks
 * Additional remarks about the global symbol.
 */

const helpCrunch = window.HelpCrunch
```
